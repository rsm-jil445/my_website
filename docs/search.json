    "text": "Simulation Experiment\nAs a reminder of how the t-statistic “works,” in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\nSuppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made.\nFurther suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\nto do: Make a plot like those on slide 43 from our first class and explain the plot to the reader. To do this, you will simulate 100,00 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You’ll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you’ll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. Comment on whether the cumulative average approaches the true difference in means.\nset.seed(42)\ncontrol_draws &lt;- rbinom(100000, size = 1, prob = 0.018) treatment_draws &lt;- rbinom(10000, size = 1, prob = 0.022)\ndiffs &lt;- replicate(10000, { mean(sample(treatment_draws, 100, replace = TRUE)) - mean(sample(control_draws, 100, replace = TRUE)) })\ncumulative_avg &lt;- cumsum(diffs) / seq_along(diffs) df &lt;- data.frame(Sample = 1:10000, CumulativeAvg = cumulative_avg)\nlibrary(ggplot2) ggplot(df, aes(x = Sample, y = CumulativeAvg)) + geom_line(color = “navy”, linewidth = 0.6) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0.004, color = “brown”, linetype = “dashed”, linewidth = 1.2) + annotate(“text”, x = 8000, y = 0.0047, label = “True Difference = 0.004”, color = “brown”) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-0.01, 0.015)) + # zoom in Y range labs( title = “Law of Large Numbers: Cumulative Average of Treatment - Control”, x = “Number of Samples”, y = “Cumulative Average Difference” ) + theme_minimal(base_size = 13) + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\nInterpretation: The cumulative average clearly approaches the true difference in means. In the early stages of the simulation, the average difference fluctuates significantly due to randomness in small sample sizes. However, as the number of samples increases, the fluctuations decrease and the cumulative average stabilizes close to the true value of 0.004. This convergence illustrates the Law of Large Numbers, which states that as the sample size grows, the sample mean tends to converge to the population mean.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nto do: Make 4 histograms like those on slide 44 from our first class at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000 and explain these plots to the reader. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. Comment on whether zero is in the “middle” of the distribution or whether it’s in the “tail.”\ncontrol_pop &lt;- rbinom(100000, 1, 0.018) treatment_pop &lt;- rbinom(100000, 1, 0.022)\nsample_diff_dist &lt;- function(n, reps = 1000) { replicate(reps, { control_sample &lt;- sample(control_pop, size = n) treatment_sample &lt;- sample(treatment_pop, size = n) mean(treatment_sample) - mean(control_sample) }) }\nsizes &lt;- c(50, 200, 500, 1000) results &lt;- lapply(sizes, sample_diff_dist)\ndf_clt &lt;- tibble( value = unlist(results), size = factor(rep(sizes, each = 1000)) )\nggplot(df_clt, aes(x = value)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.002, fill = “skyblue”, color = “black”) + geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = “dashed”, color = “darkred”, size = 1.1) + geom_vline(xintercept = 0.004, linetype = “solid”, color = “forestgreen”, size = 1.1) + facet_wrap(~ size, scales = “free”, nrow = 2) + labs( title = “Sampling Distributions of Difference in Means (Central Limit Theorem)”, x = “Average Difference (Treatment - Control)”, y = “Frequency” ) + theme_minimal(base_size = 13)\nInterpretation: These histograms illustrate the Central Limit Theorem by showing that as sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the difference in means becomes more symmetric and bell-shaped, even though the underlying data is binary. At smaller sample sizes (e.g., 50 or 200), the distributions are wide and irregular, and the null value of zero lies near the center, indicating high uncertainty and weak evidence against the null. As the sample size grows to 500 and 1000, the distributions tighten around the true effect (0.004), yet zero still remains within or close to the central mass of the distribution.."

In the early stages of the simulation, the average difference fluctuates significantly due to randomness in small sample sizes. However, as the number of samples increases, the fluctuations decrease and the cumulative average stabilizes close to the true value of 0.004. This convergence illustrates the Law of Large Numbers, which states that as the sample size grows, the sample mean tends to converge to the population mean.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\ncontrol_pop &lt;- rbinom(100000, 1, 0.018)\ntreatment_pop &lt;- rbinom(100000, 1, 0.022)\n\nsample_diff_dist &lt;- function(n, reps = 1000) {\n  replicate(reps, {\n    control_sample &lt;- sample(control_pop, size = n)\n    treatment_sample &lt;- sample(treatment_pop, size = n)\n    mean(treatment_sample) - mean(control_sample)\n  })\n}\n\nsizes &lt;- c(50, 200, 500, 1000)\nresults &lt;- lapply(sizes, sample_diff_dist)\n\ndf_clt &lt;- tibble(\n  value = unlist(results),\n  size = factor(rep(sizes, each = 1000))\n)\n\nggplot(df_clt, aes(x = value)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.002, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"darkred\", size = 1.1) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.004, linetype = \"solid\", color = \"forestgreen\", size = 1.1) +\n  facet_wrap(~ size, scales = \"free\", nrow = 2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Sampling Distributions of Difference in Means (Central Limit Theorem)\",\n    x = \"Average Difference (Treatment - Control)\",\n    y = \"Frequency\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation: These histograms illustrate the Central Limit Theorem by showing that as sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the difference in means becomes more symmetric and bell-shaped, even though the underlying data is binary. At smaller sample sizes (e.g., 50 or 200), the distributions are wide and irregular, and the null value of zero lies near the center, indicating high uncertainty and weak evidence against the null. As the sample size grows to 500 and 1000, the distributions tighten around the true effect (0.004), yet zero still remains within or close to the central mass of the distribution.."
